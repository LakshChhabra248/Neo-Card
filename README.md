**Neo-Card** is an all-in-one smart campus solution that transforms the traditional school ID into a powerful NFC-enabled tool. Developed by **Coding Crusaders**, this project addresses the limitations of cash, smart devices, and UPI within school premises by creating a secure and seamless digital ecosystem.

### üèÜ The Problem

Schools today struggle with inefficient and outdated systems:
*   **Cash Dependency:** Managing cash in canteens and stationery shops is cumbersome and prone to leakage.
*   **Manual Attendance:** Teachers waste valuable class time on manual roll calls and report generation.
*   **Security Gaps:** Limited access control and a lack of real-time student tracking pose safety concerns.
*   **Lack of Transparency:** Parents have little to no visibility into their child's in-school activities and expenditures.

### üí° Our Solution: The Neo-Card Ecosystem

Neo-Card replaces the traditional ID with a secure NFC card, connected to a powerful backend, creating a unified system for:
*   **Cashless Payments:** Secure tap-and-go payments at canteens, stationery, and fee counters.
*   **Automated Attendance:** Instant, error-free attendance marking at gates and classrooms.
*   **Secure Access Control:** Controlled access to libraries, labs, and other restricted areas.
*   **Real-time Parent Portal:** A dedicated portal for parents to monitor attendance, track spending, and top-up their child's account.

### ‚ú® Core Features (What's Ready!)

This repository contains a fully functional prototype showcasing the power of Neo-Card.

*   ‚úÖ **Robust Django Backend:** The core of our system, built with Django, handles all data management, user authentication, and transaction logic securely.
*   üíª **Intuitive Web Portals:** Fully developed web interfaces for:
    *   **Admin Dashboard:** For school management to get a complete overview.
    *   **Parent Portal:** For parents to track their child's activities and manage their account.
    *   **Teacher's View:** For simplified class management.
*   üöÄ **Live Hardware Demo with Streamlit:** An interactive Streamlit application that connects to a physical NFC card reader to demonstrate **real-time payment deduction** from a student's account. This shows our hardware-software integration capabilities.
*   üîí **Secure & Scalable:** Designed from the ground up with security and scalability in mind, ready to be deployed in a real-world school environment.
